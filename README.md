### üöÄ Flexibility

- Compatible with all modern web browsers and on mobile devices
- Support for TypeScript and Modules with example projects for both
- Ideal for size coding competitions like [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/), [starter project builds to a 7KB zip](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/js13k)
- Builds to an executable with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for distribution on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Open Source with the [MIT license](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/LICENSE) so it can be used for anything you want forever

### üõ†Ô∏è And more...

## How to use LittleJS

To get started download the latest LittleJS package from GitHub or install via npm: ```npm install littlejsengine```

*You will need to run a local web server to run LittleJS games!*

This is because web browsers just have protection from loading local files. You may see a console error like "The image element contains cross-origin data." Don't panic, it's easy to fix! If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) there is a [Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) that will handle this for you automatically. Another option is to setup a simple local web server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via npm.

## Builds

To easily include LittleJS in your game, you can use one of the pre-built js files.

- [littlejs.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.js) - The full game engine with debug mode available
- [littlejs.release.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.release.js) - The engine optimized for release builds
- [littlejs.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.min.js) - The engine in release mode and minified
- [littlejs.esm.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.esm.js) - The engine exported as a module with debug mode available
- [littlejs.esm.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.esm.min.js) - The engine exported as a minified module in release mode

To rebuild the engine you must first run ```npm install``` to setup the necessary npm dependencies. Then call ```npm run build``` to build the engine.

The starter example project includes a node js file [build.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/starter/build.js) that compresses everything into a tiny zip file using Google Closure, UglifyJS, and ECT Zip.

Debug builds of LittleJS have a special menu that can be opened by pressing the Esc key.
